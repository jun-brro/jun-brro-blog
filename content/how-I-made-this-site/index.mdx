Hello! I am junbrro, the manager of this blog. I am currently a junior of Yonsei University, majoring in NSE (Nano Science & Engineering) & EEE (Electric & Electronic Engineering). I am running this blog to share my insights over **Deep Learning Science** & **Buisness (Start-Up)** & **Web development** & etc. Let's look at this blog main theme.

## Deep Learning

I am deeply interested in the science of deep learning. I am a member of a university society where I frequently review papers and participate in implementation study groups to enhance my knowledge of deep learning. Starting with the NLP field, I now strive to stay updated on the latest technologies and research trends across various domains, including GNN and CV.

In this blog, I plan to post my reviews, summaries, and questions about the papers I read. I encourage you to leave feedback and share your insights in the comments. Let's create a space for vibrant discussion and mutual learning!

## Buisness (Start-Up)

I have multiple entrepreneurial experiences and my ultimate goal is to run my own business. By staying updated on the latest technological trends, such as deep learning, I aim to predict future industrial structures and meticulously analyze and foresee where specific needs will arise, turning these insights into viable businesses. I constantly ponder what technologies are needed not just from a technical perspective, but also from the viewpoint of the general public. I believe that technology is meaningful only when it reaches and benefits people.

## Web development (with AI)

I don't aspire to be a web developer, but I dabble in web development for the sake of my business goals, future career, and most importantly, for fun. The website you are currently viewing is built using a template from Codebucks, integrated with a Supabase database, and customized with my own logic and tweaks on a Next.js 13 platform. To enhance your experience, I manage a lot of data in my database, including post views and the comment system. I continuously update the features and UI design elements to improve the blog.

If you find any shortcomings or have ideas for new features that would be useful, please let me know anytime. Also, the repository is publicly available on my GitHub, so feel free to contribute by submitting a Pull Request.
